# Simple Stopwatch with Milliseconds

This project is a basic stopwatch web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Features

* **Start:** Starts the stopwatch.
* **Pause:** Pauses the stopwatch.
* **Reset:** Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00.000.
* **Millisecond Accuracy:** Displays time with millisecond precision.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Use the Stopwatch:**
    * Click the "Start" button to begin timing.
    * Click the "Pause" button to stop the timer.
    * Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.

## Files

* `index.html`: The HTML structure of the stopwatch.
* `style.css`: The CSS styles for the stopwatch.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript logic for the stopwatch.

## Technical Details

* The stopwatch uses JavaScript's `setInterval` function to update the displayed time every 10 milliseconds, providing millisecond accuracy.
* The javascript calculates the time elapsed since the start button was pressed, and formats it to a readable form.
* The CSS provides a clean and simple interface.
